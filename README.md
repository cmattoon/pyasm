pyasm
=====

This is me playing with assembly language and python.

The assembly (and some C) code is taken from this site: http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmexamples/

Components
----------

**examples** 
ASM programs and an attempt at a line-by line transliteration into Python. I attempt to keep the operations as close to what's actually going on. Take this with a grain of salt, and don't believe everything you read on the internet.


**virtualenv**
Building out a virtual processor/ASM REPL or something. I'm not entirely sure where this is going.
